"""
Burrowsâ€“Wheeler Transform (BWT aka block-sorting compression)
This transformation algorithm basically permutes the order of input string. It works very well with strings containing
repeating characters. This algorithm is used in other algorithms for sequence alignment, image compression, data
compression, etc.

def bwt_encrypt(cleartext, anchor='$'):
	"""
	Encrypts the `cleartext` string following BWT encryption algorithm.

	If the argument `anchor` isn't passed in, the default character '$' is used.

	Parameters
	==========
	cleartext : str
		The string to be encrypted.
	anchor : str
		The character that will help to decrypt the ciphertext (default is '$').
		This character must be unique to the string, otherwise the algorithm MAY fail.

	Raises
	======
	TypeError
		If the argument `anchor` isn't passed in as a string.
	ValueError
		If the length of `anchor` parameter is not equal to 1
		or,
		if the length of `cleartext` parameter is equal to 0.
